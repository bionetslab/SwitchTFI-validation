# Human databases:
    # Genome assembly: hg19, hg38
    # A genome assembly is a computational representation of a genome sequence. Because we are not able
    # to sequence along the complete length of a chromosome, each chromosome assembly is made up of short stretches of
    # sequenced DNA pasted together. This always creates some gaps and errors. Some assemblies are made up of sequences
    # from multiple individuals (such as human), while some from a single individual (such as cat), however each section
    # of sequence comes from one individual. This means that any region may contain alleles that are rare or even
    # private to that individual.

    # Genome annotation: refseq_r45, refseq_r80
    # In molecular biology and genetics, DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of describing the structure
    # and function of the components of a genome,[2] by analyzing and interpreting them in order to extract their
    # biological significance and understand the biological processes in which they participate. Among other things, it
    # identifies the locations of genes and all the coding regions in a genome and determines what those genes do.
